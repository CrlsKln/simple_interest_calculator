# Simple Interest Calculator

A straightforward tool for computing the interest earned or paid on a principal sum over a specific time period.

## How It Works

Users provide three key inputs:

- **Principal Amount (`p`)** – the initial sum of money.
- **Time Period (`t`)** – the investment or loan duration in years.
- **Annual Interest Rate (`r`)** – the yearly interest rate applied to the principal.

The calculator applies the standard formula:

**Simple Interest = `p × t × r`**

It then instantly outputs the calculated interest amount, offering a quick and efficient way to perform fundamental financial calculations without complexity.
